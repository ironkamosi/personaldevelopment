# Retro - What's your Superpower?

In the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649) by Diana Larsen and Esther Derby, the authors explain a retrospective as having the following steps:

* Set the Stage: make sure everyone feels safe and is in in the retro
* Gather The Data: what happened, make sure everyone has the same picture
* Generate Insights: analyze the data to find root causes
* Decide What To Do: what are experiments that could help us to improve [1% a day](https://agilestrides.com/blog/113-practices-of-extreme-programming-applied-to-management/)
* Closing: don’t just walk away but close the retro with an activity

For every step you can use an activity. 

1. You can use the following activity for the Set the Stage step:

#### Your Superpower

This is an activity you can use in a retro with Superheroes as a theme. The first question is, what is your superpower? Which skill or competence do you bring with you to the team?

Ask the people to write their superpower on a sticky note and in short explain it when necessary.

2. Then you can use the following activity for the Gather the Data stage:

#### Superhero

What do you think was super \(use Superman image\)? What do you think was strange \(use Dr. Strange image\)? What do you think was bad \(use Batman image\)? What didn’t you dare to do \(Use daredevil image\)?

Yes, I know Batman is written with an t.

This is basically the same activity as for example Liked, Learned, Longed For, but by using different terms and pictures you challenge the team and keep it fun.
